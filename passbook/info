This is the third project in which I develop the backend service of a passbook app. Merchants can do registration and their info is saved in Mysql. Besides, they can broadcast some passes to
clients through the kafka service. The pass info is saved in hbase and the token of the pass is saved in radis. As a client, you can use any available pass if some constraints are
satisfied(time, number limit,...). Besides, you can write some comments about the app or the passes. Also codes are written in JAVA with the help of maven, spring boot, JPA.
